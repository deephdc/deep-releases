What’s new
~~~~~~~~~~

This versions adds InfiniBand support for OpenStack in
LDIF format:

* cloud-info-provider shall provides now information, through GLUE2ResourceID,
  when a given OpenStack flavor provides InfiniBand.

* The convention is to use the extra_specs parameter from the flavor’s
  metadata. This parameter is a list of key:value pairs, where the both key’s
  and value’s names are not fixed. The provider should allow to define the
  key’s name and the value string to match via command-line options. The
  InfiniBand support will be published through the
  GLUE2ExecutionEnvironmentNetworkInfo attribute.
