Alien4Cloud - DEEP plugin
=========================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

The **Alien4Cloud - DEEP plugin** is the first step towards the adoption of a 
visual composition approach of TOSCA templates (based on
Alien4Cloud), in order to facilitate the widespread adoption of the
standard, and its integration with the INDIGO-DataCloud Orchestrator,
which is already part of the EOSC-HUB service catalogue.

- With this approach, the user can visually compose complex applications that
  involve, for example, the dynamic deployment of a container orchestration
  platform on an IaaS Cloud site that executes a
  highly-available Docker-based application to facilitate appication
  delivery.

- The users can also deploy an Apache Mesos cluster with GPU
  support that contains a deep learning application for the recognition of
  certain plant species, offered as a service to a community of users.
  This introduces unprecedented flexibility, from visual composition, to
  the automated application delivery, using a graphical interface that is
  already integrated with an Orchestrator layer that performs resource
  provision from multiple Clouds and application configuration.

- The integration of easy-to-use graphical interfaces builds a bridge between
  the users and the orchestration services.It also represents a step
  forward to foster the adoption of innovative computing services that are
  hidden from the user, as they can focus on the high-level description of
  the services requirements and definition, instead of working on their
  technical implementation.
