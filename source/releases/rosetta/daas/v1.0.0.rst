v 1.0.0
------

Whatâ€™s new
~~~~~~~~~~

* New debug option, can be enabled with the --debug-endpoint. This will 
activate the /debug endpoint where all the output generated by the model (i.e. using print) 
or logged in the deepaas.api logger will be shown.
* New V2 version of the API. This is a major change that is not backwards compatible. 
We also have moved away from Flask to aiohttp in order to support async requests. Please 
read these notes carefully so that you can upgrade your model along with this new version.
* Moved from the OpenAPI Specification version 3 and Swagger UI 3.X.
* Added new -predict-workers and -train-workers options, allowing to specify the number of 
workers that will be used for model operations (train, predict).
* New warm method allow to initialize the model before the API is spawned.
* Support for multiple, versioned endpoints.
