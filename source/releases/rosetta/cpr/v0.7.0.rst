   * Code re-engineered using Spring Boot framework
   * Modified ranking algorithm:

       * the Drools rules have been updated accordingly
    * Modified interface for /rank API (json request/response)
    * Updated documentation

* Fixed:
    * Fixed issue with ranking services that have the same SLA priority, now they are ranked using the monitoring metrics, if available.
    * Fixed code style issues
    * Fixed rmp/deb creation

* Removed:
    * The following endpoints have been removed:
    
    .. code-block:: bash
        /get-sla-parameters
