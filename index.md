Welcome to DEEP-HybridDataCloud Releases pages!

The** D**esigning and **E**nabling **E**-infrastructures for intensive **P**rocessing in a **Hybrid DataCloud** (DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud) is project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 777435. 
 
**Global objective**: Promote the use of intensive computing services by different research communities and areas, an the support by the corresponding e-Infrastructure providers and open source projects.

**Specific objectives**:

* **Focus **on **intensive computing techniques** for the analysis of **very large datasets** considering demanding use cases
	* Pilot applications from different research communities
	* Improved list of requirements for e-Infrastructures → future generation
* **Evolve** up to production level **intensive computing services **exploiting **specialized hardware**
	* New solutions to better interact with bare metal resources in the cloud
* **Integrate** intensive computing services under a** hybrid cloud** approach
	* Assuring interoperability with existing EOSC ecosystem
	* Expanding over multiple IaaS using high level networking technologies
* **Define** a **“DEEP as a Service”** solution to offer an adequate integration path to developers of final applications
	* Implement a **catalog** of the most useful services and applications as **well defined building blocks**
	* Offer a **DevOps approach** for the application development
* **Analyse** the **complementarity with other ongoing projects** targeting added value services for the cloud
	* Explore different e-Infrastructures and complementary services and projects
	* Identification, integration and/or co-development of missing functionalities

You'll find here usefull information regarding the DEEP-HybridDataCloud services and components **releases**, their schedules, documentation and support.

## Release Schedule
* Time-based releases - projects' **Major releases** - the DEEP-HybridDataCloud project foresees two major releases, distributions, during its lifetime, at around 10 months since the start of the project. 
* As-soon-as-available - components' **Minor/Revision releases** - Development teams (aka Product Teams) can release updated versions of their components as soon as the DEEP-HDC software quality criteria are met. Thought the project Continuous Integration and Deplivery System tests are continuously run giving feedback on the status of the components.

### Support Model
 * in a Major Release for each component or service only the latest revision released is supported.
 * for each component or service a (major) release is supported at least for the lifetime of the projects' major release in which this version was released the first time.
